  * Aggregate design blogs of open source projects

## 2. Make designers contributors
  * Git workshops
  * Provide resources about how to collaborate for designers
  * Meetups / events / hackathons for designers who want to contribute to OS
  * Work with design students at university
  * Think about how to make OS contributions more rewarding and attractive for designers

## 3. Communication between designers and developers
  * An open job board for designers to find open source projects
  * Develop guidelines on how to write documentation, issues, comments that designers (or non-technical contributors in general) can work with
  * Create guidelines on how to present a design to a community with reasoning. And how the community can review the design in a constructive way

## 4. Connect the existing open source design community
  * FOSDEM open source design devroom, Libre Graphics Meeting
  * Go to conferences of other open source projects: GUADEC, DrupalCon, â€¦
  * Approach open source companies in supporting the open source design movement

## 5. Funding for open source design
  * Contact foundations who already fund open source projects: NLnet, Knight Foundation, Shuttleworth

## 7. Work on improving the design of open source projects
